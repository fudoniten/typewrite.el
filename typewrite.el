;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Typewrite provides a typewriter effect for inserting text into Emacs buffers.
;; Instead of inserting text all at once, it gradually reveals the text
;; character by character at a configurable rate, creating a more dynamic
;; and pleasant visual experience.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Configurable typing speed (characters per second)
;; - Multiple simultaneous jobs in different buffers
;; - Auto-scrolling to follow the insertion point
;; - Budget-based character accumulation for smooth animation
;; - Proper timer cleanup when jobs complete
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (typewrite-enqueue-job "Hello, world!" (current-buffer)
;;                          :cps 50
;;                          :follow t)
;;
;; This is particularly useful for displaying LLM responses, log output,
;; or any other text where a gradual reveal enhances the user experience.
